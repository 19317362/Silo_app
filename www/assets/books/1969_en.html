<p>If you have come to listen to a man who it is thought transmits wisdom,
you have mistaken your way, for true wisdom is not communicated through
books or speeches—true wisdom is found in the depths of your
consciousness, just as true love is found in the depths of your heart.
If you have come at the urging of slanderers and hypocrites to listen to
this man so that what you hear today may later be used against him, you
have mistaken your way, because this man has not come here to ask
anything of you or to use you, because he does not need you.</p>

<p>You are listening to a man who does not know the laws that rule the
Universe, who is not privy to the laws of History, who is ignorant of
the relationships that govern the peoples of the world. High in these
mountains, far from the cities and their sick ambitions, this man
addresses himself to your conscience. Over the cities, where each day is
a struggle—a hope cut short by death—where love is followed by hate,
where forgiveness is followed by revenge; over the cities of the people
rich and poor; over the immense fields of humanity, a mantle of
suffering and sorrow has fallen. You suffer when pain bites your body.
You suffer when hunger seizes your body. But you suffer not only from
your body’s immediate pain and hunger, you also suffer from the
consequences of the diseases that afflict it.</p>

<p>We must distinguish between two types of suffering. There is the
suffering that occurs during illness, which recedes with the advance of
science, just as hunger can recede if the empire of justice advances.
There is also the suffering that does not depend on the sickness of your
body but yet derives from that sickness: If you are disabled, if you
cannot see, if you cannot hear, you suffer. But though such suffering
derives from your body, or from the diseases of your body, that
suffering is of your mind.</p>

<p>There is yet another kind of suffering that does not recede even with
the advance of science or with the advance of justice. This type of
suffering, which belongs strictly to your mind, retreats before faith,
before joy in life, before love. You must understand that this suffering
is always rooted in the violence that exists in your own consciousness.
You suffer because you fear losing what you have, or because of what you
have already lost, or because of what you desperately long to reach. You
suffer because of what you lack, or because you fear in general.</p>

<p>These, then, are the great enemies of humanity: fear of sickness, fear
of poverty, fear of death, fear of loneliness. All these forms of
suffering pertain to your mind, and all of them reveal your inner
violence, the violence that is in your mind. Notice how that violence
always stems from desire. The more violent a person is, the more gross
are that person’s desires.</p>

<p>I would like to tell you a story that took place long ago.</p>

<p>There was once a traveler who had to undertake a long journey. He yoked
his animal to a cart and began the journey to his faraway destination, a
journey he had to complete within a certain length of time. He called
the animal Necessity and the cart Desire; one wheel of the cart he
called Pleasure, and the other he called Pain. Our traveler turned his
cart sometimes to the right and sometimes to the left, yet he never
ceased moving toward his destiny. The faster the cart traveled, the
faster turned the wheels of Pleasure and Pain, carrying as they did the
cart of Desire and connected as they were by the same axle.</p>

<p>But the journey was very long, and after a time our traveler grew bored.
So he decided to decorate his cart, and he began to adorn it with all
manner of beautiful things. But the more he embellished the cart of
Desire with these ornaments, the heavier became the load for Necessity
to pull. On the curves and steep hills of the road, the poor animal grew
too exhausted to pull the cart of Desire. And where the road was soft,
the wheels of Pleasure and Suffering became mired in the earth.</p>

<p>One day, because the road was long and he was still very far from his
destination, our traveler grew desperate. That night he decided to
meditate on the problem, and in the midst of his meditation he heard the
neighing of his old friend, Necessity. Comprehending the message, he
arose very early the next morning and began to lighten the cart of its
burden, stripping it of all its fine adornments. Then he set off once
more toward his destination, with the animal Necessity pulling the cart
at a brisk trot. Still, our traveler had already lost much time—time
that was now irrecoverable. The next night he sat down again to
meditate, and he realized, thanks to another message from his old
friend, that now he had to undertake a task that was doubly difficult
because it involved his letting go. At daybreak he sacrificed the cart
of Desire. It is true that when he did so he lost the wheel of Pleasure,
but then he also lost the wheel of Suffering. And so, abandoning the
cart of Desire, he mounted the animal called Necessity and galloped on
its back across the green fields until he reached his destiny.</p>

<p>See how desire can trap you. But notice that there are desires of
different qualities. There are cruder desires, and there are more
elevated desires. Elevate desire, purify desire, surpass desire! In
doing so, surely you will have to sacrifice the wheel of Pleasure—but
you will also become free of the wheel of Suffering.</p>

<p>Spurred by desire, the violence in a person does not simply remain like
a sickness in the consciousness of that person—it acts in the world of
other people and is exercised upon them. And do not think that when I
talk of violence I am speaking only about the armed act of war, where
some men destroy others. That is only one form of physical violence.</p>

<p>There is also economic violence. Economic violence is the violence
through which you exploit other people; economic violence occurs when
you steal from another, when you are no longer a brother or sister to
others but a bird of prey feeding upon them.</p>

<p>There is also racial violence. Or do you think that you are not being
violent when you persecute someone because that person is not of your
own race? Do you think that you are not engaging in violence when you
malign that person for being of a race different from your own?</p>

<p>And there is religious violence: Do you think that you are not engaging
in violence when you refuse work to, close your doors to, or dismiss a
person, because that person does not share your religious beliefs? Do
you believe that it is not violence when you use words of hate to build
walls around other people, excluding them from your society, because
they do not share your religious beliefs—isolating them within their
families, segregating them and their loved ones, because they do not
share your religion?</p>

<p>There are other forms of violence that are imposed by the Philistine
morality. You wish to impose your way of life upon another; you wish to
impose your vocation upon another. But who has told you that you are an
example that must be followed? Who has told you that you can impose a
way of life because it pleases you? What makes your way of life a model,
a pattern that you have the right to impose on others? This, then, is
another form of violence. </p>

<p>Only inner faith and inner meditation can end the violence in you, in
others, and in the world around you. All the other doors are false and
do not lead away from this violence. This world is on the verge of
exploding with no way to end the violence! Do not choose false doors.
There are no politics that can solve this mad urge for violence. There
is no political party or movement on the planet that can end the
violence. Do not choose false doors that promise to lead away from the
violence in the world… I have heard that all over the world young people
are turning to false doors to try to escape the violence and inner
suffering. They turn to drugs as a solution. Do not choose false doors
to try to end the violence.</p>

<p>My brother, my sister, keep these simple commandments, as simple as
these rocks, this snow, and this sun that bless us. Carry peace within
you, and carry it to others. My brother, my sister—if you look back in
history, you will see the human being bearing the face of suffering.
Remember, even as you gaze at that suffering face, that it is necessary
to move forward, and it is necessary to learn to laugh, and it is
necessary to learn to love.</p>

<p>To you, my brother and sister, I cast this hope—this hope of joy, this
hope of love—so that you elevate your heart and elevate your spirit, and
so that you do not forget to elevate your body.</p>
